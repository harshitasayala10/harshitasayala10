### üöÄ My Featured Projects

Here are some of my key projects, demonstrating my expertise in data analytics, machine learning, and data engineering. Each link leads to a dedicated repository with full details, code, and often visualizations or demos.

#### üö® [Big Data Analytics for UK Police Crime Data](https://github.com/katipally/crime-data-analysis)
* **Description:** Designed and implemented an end-to-end big data analytics pipeline using **Apache Hadoop (HDFS)** and **Apache Spark (PySpark, MLlib)** to analyze massive, inconsistent UK Police Crime datasets. Identified crime hotspots using K-Means clustering and revealed significant crime type-resolution relationships with Chi-Square Test ($p=0.0$).
* **Key Achievements:** Forecasted crime occurrences with **ARIMA(1,1,1)** (RMSE 16,830, MAE 13,426). Transformed data into actionable intelligence for data-informed policing.
* **Technologies:** `Apache Hadoop`, `Apache Spark (PySpark, MLlib)`, `ARIMA`, `K-Means`, `Chi-Square Test`, `Parquet`

#### üèôÔ∏è [Smart Urban Planning - Optimizing City Layouts based on Air Quality Trends](https://github.com/meera2632/DATA-245_Project)
* **Description:** Developed a comprehensive machine learning pipeline to **predict, classify, cluster, and forecast AQI** using diverse city-level datasets. Applied dual K-Means clustering to segment cities into 4 actionable urban typologies for targeted planning.
* **Key Achievements:** Achieved **94.10% R¬≤ and RMSE <6** for AQI prediction (Random Forest, XGBoost); improved classification accuracy to **89%** (SMOTE, PCA). Delivered insights supporting UN SDG 11.
* **Technologies:** `Random Forest`, `XGBoost`, `K-Means`, `SMOTE`, `PCA`, `Python`

#### üéµ [Spotify Trend and Popularity Prediction](https://github.com/wcc0/DATA226)
* **Description:** Designed a **real-time + batch data pipeline** using **Apache Airflow** to automate daily ingestion of 50K+ records from the Spotify API into **Snowflake**. Built and tuned **ARIMA-based time-series models** to forecast artist popularity.
* **Key Achievements:** Improved prediction accuracy by **30%** (RMSE reduced from 12.4 to 8.6). Developed interactive dashboards in **Apache Superset** for near-real-time trend insights.
* **Technologies:** `Apache Airflow`, `Snowflake`, `ARIMA`, `Apache Superset`, `Python`, `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`

#### üíπ [Cloud-Native Stock Price Analytics & Prediction](https://github.com/meera2632/DATA-226_Lab-2)
* **Description:** Developed a robust, **cloud-native data analytics pipeline** for real-time and historical stock market data, utilizing **Apache Airflow for orchestration, Snowflake as a data warehouse, dbt for transformation, and Preset for visualization.**
* **Key Achievements:** Automated data fetching (yfinance API), engineered streamlined ETL with **dbt** (including incremental UPSERT, error handling, dbt snapshots), and implemented **ARIMA models** for forecasting. Delivered actionable insights via intuitive Preset dashboards.
* **Technologies:** `Apache Airflow`, `Snowflake`, `dbt`, `Preset`, `ARIMA`, `yfinance API`, `SQL`

#### ‚öñÔ∏è [LegalDoc AI ‚Äì Intelligent Legal Document Assistant using LLMs and RAG]
